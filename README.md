# jokes_app_orientation

A new Flutter project. 
A simple jokes app, its main motive is to learn the orientation or the presentation data in both mobile phone and in tablet. 
In mobile if the orientation is potrait the list will route to a new screen as shown below in screen shots,
## potrait
<img src="screenshots/1.jpeg" width="250">|<img src="screenshots/2.jpeg" width="250">

but if the orientation is in landscape mode then the list will be displayed on left side and the context of that list will be displayed on the right side

## landscape
<img src="screenshots/3.jpeg" width="500">|<img src="screenshots/4.jpeg" width="500">


A another way of orientation is to view in tablet which has a quite broad screen and has more Pexels thus the way of presentation will be as a landscape presentation in mobile.
